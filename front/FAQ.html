        <div class="question" onclick="toggleAnswer(this)">What is the Mifflin equation?</div>
        <div class="answer">
            The Mifflin-St Jeor equation is a formula used to estimate the number of calories your body
            needs at rest, also known as the Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR). It takes into account your age, gender, weight,
            and height to provide a more accurate estimate compared to other formulas.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
        <div class="question" onclick="toggleAnswer(this)">What is Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR)?</div>
        <div class="answer">
            Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR) is the amount of energy expended by the body while at rest in a
            neutrally temperate environment, in the post-absorptive state (meaning that the digestive system is
            inactive, typically 12 hours after eating). It represents the minimum amount of energy needed to maintain
            basic physiological functions such as breathing, circulation, cell production, and maintenance of body
            temperature. <br>
            In other words, BMR is the number of calories your body requires to perform essential functions while at
            rest. It's often expressed in calories per day. BMR is influenced by several factors, including age, gender,
            weight, height, and body composition. Generally, BMR decreases with age and tends to be higher in
            individuals with more lean muscle mass.</div>

    <div class="faq-item">
        <div class="question" onclick="toggleAnswer(this)">What is an Activity Factor?</div>
        <div class="answer">
            The activity factor is a number that is used to multiply with your Basal Metabolic Rate. This helps accounts
            for extra calories burned throughout the day. It gives a more accurate reading of how much daily Calories
            one would need. <br>
            For example, if we take a 150lbs male athlete and a 150lbs average male that are both the same age, they
            will have the same BMR. However, since the athlete does more activities throughout the day, they burn more
            calories. They need to replace those lost calories, which is why their caloric needs are higher. The
            activity level will account for the activities for each person and will help calculate an accurate reading
            of caloric needs.
